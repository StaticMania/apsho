            A lot has changed about how we work, and most people have no choice
            but to transition to working from home. But even before the
            pandemic, an increasing number of people bid goodbye to their
            onerous commute to become freelancers and telecommuters. Thanks to
            ever-evolving technologies such as Skype, Zoom, Facetime, Google
            Hangouts, Slack, and cloud computing, it’s no longer necessary to be
            in an office to be productive. In fact, most tasks can be done just
            as effectively from home.

            Working from home can be one of the greatest perks of doing
            freelance work. But as appealing as remote work sounds, it comes
            with several challenges. What if you need something important from
            the office that you have no access to? What if loneliness takes over
            and you experience time management problems? What if you lose
            connection with colleagues? What if you’re overwhelmed by other
            home-related distractions like family members, pets, and
            electronics?

            We are creatures of habit – and that is because routine helps us
            both mentally and physically to prepare for things. One of the
            benefits of working from home is flexibility. It might be tempting
            to roll out of bed and onto your couch and starting checking emails
            or browsing through social media, but you’ll need to establish a
            schedule when it comes to working remotely. <br />
            <br />
            What’s goes into your schedule is a guide on what you’re supposed to
            do at a specific time. Get up early in the morning, take a shower,
            prepare a cup of coffee and take breakfast, then get dressed as if
            you’re actually reporting to work. You don’t have to wear a suit and
            a tie, but you’ll need to prepare for the day the same way you do
            while going to the office. Set regular working hours and include
            breaks and meal times. In the end, a routine can be extremely
            powerful at helping you get started every day.
