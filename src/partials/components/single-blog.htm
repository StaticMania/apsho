          <h2>With more and more people working from home, either from choice or necessity, it's important to know the
            best practices to stay healthy and productive</h2>
          <p>A lot has changed about how we work, and most people have no choice but to transition to working from home.
            But even before the pandemic, an increasing number of people bid goodbye to their onerous commute to become
            freelancers and telecommuters. Thanks to ever-evolving technologies such as Skype, Zoom, Facetime, Google
            Hangouts, Slack, and cloud computing, it’s no longer necessary to be in an office to be productive. In fact,
            most tasks can be done just as effectively from home.</p>

          <p>Working from home can be one of the greatest perks of doing freelance work. But as appealing as remote work
            sounds, it comes with several challenges. What if you need something important from the office that you have
            no access to? What if loneliness takes over and you experience time management problems? What if you lose
            connection with colleagues? What if you’re overwhelmed by other home-related distractions like family
            members, pets, and electronics?

            handy tips and best practices for working from home.

          <ul>
            <li>Setting a Healthy Routine</li>

          <h2>Setting a Healthy Routine</h2>
          <img src="images/blog/single-blog-5.jpg" alt="banner">
          <p>We are creatures of habit – and that is because routine helps us both mentally and physically to prepare
            for things. One of the benefits of working from home is flexibility. It might be tempting to roll out of bed
            and onto your couch and starting checking emails or browsing through social media, but you’ll need to
            establish a schedule when it comes to working remotely. <br> <br>
            What’s goes into your schedule is a guide on what you’re supposed to do at a specific time. Get up early in
            the morning, take a shower, prepare a cup of coffee and take breakfast, then get dressed as if you’re
            actually reporting to work. You don’t have to wear a suit and a tie, but you’ll need to prepare for the day
            the same way you do while going to the office. Set regular working hours and include breaks and meal times.
            In the end, a routine can be extremely powerful at helping you get started every day.</p>
          <h2>Proper Ergonomics</h2>
          <img src="images/blog/single-blog-6.jpg" alt="banner">
          <p>Many offices offer in-house employees adjustable monitor stands, wrist supports, stand-up-desks, and other
            tools to help combat risks related to ergonomic or musculoskeletal ailments, such as carpal tunnel syndrome
            and tendonitis. The main focus is to help you maintain a neutral spine – one that stays in its natural
            curved shape. Ergonomics, or fitting a job to an individual, can also help reduce instances of muscle
            fatigue and increase productivity. <br> <br>Unfortunately, many of us likely don’t have the same workstation
            setup at home. Having an ergonomically optimized workspace helps you work safely and efficiently. It is
            imperative to have a proper workstation to prevent such injuries irrespective of where we might work. Since
            you’ll be working from home, you can make some simple adjustments to your workspace to help optimize your
            posture and improve your comfort when working from home.</p>
